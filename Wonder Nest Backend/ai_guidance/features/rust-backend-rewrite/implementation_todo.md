# Implementation Todo: Rust Backend Rewrite

## Pre-Implementation
- [x] Review existing Kotlin backend structure
- [x] Document API contracts
- [ ] Choose Rust web framework (Axum vs Actix-Web)
- [ ] Choose ORM (SQLx vs Diesel)

## Project Setup

- [ ] Initialize Cargo project
- [ ] Set up workspace structure
- [ ] Configure dependencies

## Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Database connection pool setup
- [ ] Redis connection setup
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Logging infrastructure
- [ ] Error handling framework

## Authentication & Security
- [ ] JWT middleware implementation
- [ ] Token validation
- [ ] Refresh token logic
- [ ] PIN verification
- [ ] Session management

## API Routes Implementation
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Auth routes (/api/v1/auth/*)
- [ ] Family routes (/api/v1/family/*)
- [ ] Content pack routes (/api/v1/content-packs/*)

- [ ] File upload routes (/api/v1/upload/*)
- [ ] Analytics routes (/api/v1/analytics/*)
- [ ] COPPA compliance routes (/api/v1/coppa/*)

## Database Layer
