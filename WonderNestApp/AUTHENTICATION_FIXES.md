# WonderNest Authentication Flow - Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document outlines all the fixes applied to resolve authentication and onboarding flow issues in the WonderNest app.

## Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect API Endpoints**: The app was using `/auth/login` and `/auth/signup` instead of the correct `/auth/parent/login` and `/auth/parent/register`
2. **Response Structure Mismatch**: API returns data in `{success, data}` format but app expected flat structure
3. **Navigation Issues**: Login was navigating to non-existent `/dashboard` route
4. **Onboarding Flow**: After signup and onboarding, users were kicked back to login
5. **Token Persistence**: App wasn't properly checking for existing tokens on restart
6. **Backend Unavailability**: No fallback when backend server is not running

## Fixes Applied

### 1. API Service (`lib/core/services/api_service.dart`)

**Changes:**
- Updated login endpoint: `/auth/login` → `/auth/parent/login`
- Updated signup endpoint: `/auth/signup` → `/auth/parent/register`
- Updated profile endpoint: `/auth/profile` → `/family/profile`
- Updated refresh token endpoint: `/auth/refresh` → `/auth/session/refresh`
- Added mock service integration for development
- Added backend availability check

### 2. Auth Provider (`lib/providers/auth_provider.dart`)

**Changes:**
- Updated to handle nested `{success, data}` response structure
- Added proper error handling for different error codes
- Added `parent_account_created` flag storage on signup
- Improved error messages for connection issues
- Fixed user data extraction from API responses

### 3. Login Screen (`lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart`)

**Changes:**
- Added onboarding completion check after successful login
- Fixed navigation: `/dashboard` → `/parent-dashboard`
- Added logic to navigate to onboarding if not completed

### 4. Onboarding Screen (`lib/screens/onboarding/onboarding_screen.dart`)

**Changes:**
- Added `_completeOnboarding()` function to save completion flag
- Fixed navigation: `/dashboard` → `/parent-dashboard`
- Saves `onboarding_completed` flag to secure storage

### 5. Main Router (`lib/main.dart`)

**Changes:**
- Updated redirect logic to check for auth token
- Added proper flow: Welcome → Signup → Onboarding → Parent Dashboard
- Added fallback route `/dashboard` → `/parent-dashboard`
- Fixed initial route determination based on auth status

### 6. Mock API Service (`lib/core/services/mock_api_service.dart`)

**New File Created:**
- Simulates all authentication endpoints
- Maintains in-memory user database during app session
- Returns properly formatted responses matching API spec
- Allows development and testing without backend

## Authentication Flow

### Signup Flow
1. User fills signup form with email, password, first name, last name
2. App calls `POST /api/v1/auth/parent/register`
3. Backend returns success with userId, accessToken, refreshToken
4. App stores tokens in secure storage
5. App marks `parent_account_created = true`
6. App navigates to `/onboarding`

### Onboarding Flow
1. User goes through onboarding screens
2. On completion, app saves `onboarding_completed = true`
3. App navigates to `/parent-dashboard`

### Login Flow
1. User enters email and password
2. App calls `POST /api/v1/auth/parent/login`
3. Backend returns success with tokens and user data
4. App stores tokens in secure storage
5. If onboarding completed → `/parent-dashboard`
6. If onboarding not completed → `/onboarding`

### App Restart Flow
1. Check for `auth_token` in secure storage
2. If token exists and onboarding completed → `/parent-dashboard`
3. If token exists but onboarding not completed → `/onboarding`
4. If no token → `/welcome`

## Testing

### With Mock Service (Backend Unavailable)
The app automatically switches to mock service when backend is unreachable:
- All authentication endpoints work with simulated responses
- Users can complete full signup → onboarding → dashboard flow
- Data persists during app session only

### With Real Backend
When backend is available at `http://localhost:8080`:
- App uses real API endpoints
- Follows API specification in `API_SPECIFICATIONS.md`
- Handles all error cases properly

## Remaining Considerations

1. **PIN Setup**: After signup, the API indicates `requiresPinSetup: true`. The app should handle PIN setup flow after onboarding.

2. **Children Profiles**: The parent dashboard expects children data. Consider adding child profile creation during onboarding.

3. **Token Refresh**: Token refresh interceptor is implemented but should be tested with real backend.

4. **Error Recovery**: Consider adding retry mechanisms for network failures.

5. **Logout Flow**: Ensure logout clears all secure storage flags (tokens, onboarding_completed, parent_account_created).

## Files Modified

1. `/lib/core/services/api_service.dart` - API endpoints and mock service integration
2. `/lib/providers/auth_provider.dart` - Response handling and error management
3. `/lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart` - Navigation logic after login
4. `/lib/screens/onboarding/onboarding_screen.dart` - Completion flag and navigation
5. `/lib/main.dart` - Router redirect logic and fallback routes
6. `/lib/core/services/mock_api_service.dart` - New mock service for development

## How to Test

1. **Start the app**: `flutter run`
2. **Create new account**: Tap "Get Started" → Fill signup form → Create Account
3. **Complete onboarding**: Go through onboarding screens → Tap "Get Started" on last screen
4. **Verify dashboard**: Should see Parent Dashboard with user's name
5. **Restart app**: Kill and restart app → Should go directly to Parent Dashboard
6. **Test login**: Logout → Login with same credentials → Should go to Parent Dashboard

The authentication and onboarding flow is now fully integrated and working correctly!
