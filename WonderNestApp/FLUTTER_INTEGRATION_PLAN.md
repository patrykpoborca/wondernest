## Technical Architecture

### State Management
```
- Riverpod for global state
- Local state for UI components
- Persistent storage for settings
- Secure storage for sensitive data
```

### Security Layers
```
1. App Mode (Kid/Parent)
2. PIN Protection
3. Session Management
4. Data Encryption
5. COPPA Compliance
```

### API Integration Points
```
- Authentication & Authorization
- User Profile Management
- Content Management
- Activity Tracking
- Settings Synchronization
- Parental Controls
```

## API Endpoint Specifications

```

### Family Management
```
GET    /api/v1/family/profile
POST   /api/v1/family/children
PUT    /api/v1/family/children/{childId}
DELETE /api/v1/family/children/{childId}
GET    /api/v1/family/children/{childId}/profile
```

### Content Control
```
GET    /api/v1/content/filters
PUT    /api/v1/content/filters
GET    /api/v1/content/whitelist
POST   /api/v1/content/whitelist
DELETE /api/v1/content/whitelist/{contentId}
```

### Activity Tracking
```
POST   /api/v1/activity/track
GET    /api/v1/activity/child/{childId}/summary
GET    /api/v1/activity/child/{childId}/detailed
POST   /api/v1/activity/subtitle-exposure
```

### Parental Controls
```
GET    /api/v1/controls/settings
PUT    /api/v1/controls/settings
GET    /api/v1/controls/time-limits
PUT    /api/v1/controls/time-limits
GET    /api/v1/controls/app-restrictions
PUT    /api/v1/controls/app-restrictions
```

### Mini-Games
```
GET    /api/v1/games/whitelist
POST   /api/v1/games/whitelist
DELETE /api/v1/games/whitelist/{gameId}
POST   /api/v1/games/progress
GET    /api/v1/games/child/{childId}/achievements
```

### COPPA Compliance
```
POST   /api/v1/coppa/consent
GET    /api/v1/coppa/consent/status
PUT    /api/v1/coppa/consent/update
GET    /api/v1/coppa/data-request
POST   /api/v1/coppa/data-deletion
```

## Security Considerations
1. All sensitive data encrypted at rest
2. PIN stored using secure hashing (bcrypt)
3. Session tokens with automatic expiration
4. Audio processing only on-device
5. No raw audio data transmission
6. COPPA-compliant data handling

## Performance Targets
- App launch to Kid Mode: < 2 seconds
- Mode switching: < 500ms
- Audio processing latency: < 100ms
- API response time: < 200ms
- Smooth 60fps animations

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for all business logic
2. Widget tests for UI components
3. Integration tests for API calls
4. Security penetration testing
5. COPPA compliance audit
6. Performance benchmarking

## Deployment Plan
1. Internal testing build
2. Beta release to selected families
3. Gradual rollout with monitoring
4. Full production release
5. Post-launch monitoring and updates

## Success Metrics
- User engagement in Kid Mode
- Parent satisfaction scores
- Security incident rate (target: 0)
- COPPA compliance rating
- App store ratings
- Daily active users
