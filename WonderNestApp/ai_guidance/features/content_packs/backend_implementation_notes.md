# Backend Implementation Notes

## Current Status
The backend implementation for content packs is partially complete but has been temporarily disabled due to compilation issues. The Flutter app is currently using the MockApiService which provides full functionality for testing.

## What's Implemented
1. **Database Schema** - Complete migration file (V26__Add_Content_Packs_System.sql) with 11 tables
2. **Kotlin Models** - Data classes for ContentPack, ContentPackAsset, etc.
3. **Service Layer** - ContentPackService with business logic (needs fixes)
4. **API Routes** - ContentPackRoutes with all endpoints defined
5. **Table Definitions** - Exposed ORM tables (needs array type fixes)

## Issues to Fix
1. **Array Column Types**: Exposed doesn't have native array support. Need to use JSONB for:
   - educationalGoals
   - curriculumTags
   - previewUrls
   - moodTags
   - supportedPlatforms

2. **Name Conflicts**: Table objects and data classes have the same names causing ambiguity

3. **Missing Dependencies**: Need to properly set up:
   - JSON serialization configuration
   - Repository implementations
   - Database transaction handling

## Temporary Solution
- Backend routes are commented out in Routing.kt
- ContentPackService is not registered in Koin
- Flutter app uses MockApiService which works perfectly

## To Complete Backend
1. Fix array columns to use JSONB with proper serialization
2. Rename either table objects or data classes to avoid conflicts
3. Implement repository pattern for database access
4. Add proper transaction handling
5. Write unit tests
6. Re-enable routes and service registration

## Why This Approach Works
The Mock API provides all the functionality needed for:
- Browsing content packs
- Searching and filtering
- Selecting packs in AI story creation
- Usage tracking simulation
- Testing the complete user flow

The backend can be properly implemented later without affecting the frontend functionality.
