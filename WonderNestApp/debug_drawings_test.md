# Debug Test for Crayon Drawings Not Loading

## Issue
Crayon drawings are not loading properly when a saved project is loaded. Drawings appear in thumbnails but not when the project is opened.

## Comprehensive Logging Added
Added extensive logging throughout the entire save/load pipeline:

### 1. SavedProjectsService (`saved_projects_service.dart`)
- `saveProject()`: Logs project data being saved, including drawing count and details
- `getSavedProjects()`: Logs project data being loaded, verifying drawings are in JSON

### 2. StickerBookGame (`sticker_book_game.dart`)
- `_loadProject()`: Logs project loading details and drawing data
- `_onCanvasChanged()`: Logs all canvas changes and drawing updates
- `_buildCanvasWidget()`: Logs canvas widget building with drawing count

### 3. CreativeCanvasWidget (`creative_canvas.dart`)
- `initState()`: Logs canvas initialization
- `didUpdateWidget()`: Logs when canvas data changes
- `build()`: Logs canvas building with drawing count
- `_finishDrawing()`: Logs stroke creation and canvas updates

### 4. DrawingStroke Model (`sticker_models.dart`)
- `toJson()`: Logs serialization of each drawing stroke
- `fromJson()`: Logs deserialization of each drawing stroke

### 5. CreativeCanvas Model (`sticker_models.dart`)
- `toJson()`: Logs canvas serialization with drawing count
- `fromJson()`: Logs canvas deserialization with drawing count

### 6. CanvasPainter (`creative_canvas.dart`)
- `paint()`: Logs all drawings being rendered

## Widget Keys Added
Added unique keys to force widget rebuilds:
- `CreativeCanvasWidget` uses `ValueKey('canvas_${canvas.id}_${canvas.lastModified.millisecondsSinceEpoch}')`
- Simple canvas uses `ValueKey('simple_canvas_${canvas.id}_${canvas.lastModified.millisecondsSinceEpoch}')`
- Infinite canvas uses `ValueKey('infinite_${canvas.id}_${canvas.lastModified.millisecondsSinceEpoch}')`

## Test Steps
1. Run the app
2. Create a new sticker book project
3. Draw some crayon strokes
4. Add some stickers for comparison
5. Save the project (watch logs for save process)
6. Load the saved project (watch logs for load process)
7. Observe if drawings appear vs just stickers

## Expected Log Flow
1. **Drawing Creation**: `[CreativeCanvas] Created stroke with X points...`
2. **Canvas Update**: `[StickerBookGame] Canvas changed - drawings: X`
3. **Save Process**: `[SavedProjectsService] Canvas has X drawings`
4. **Save Serialization**: `[CreativeCanvas.toJson] Serializing canvas...`
5. **Load Process**: `[SavedProjectsService] Project has X drawings`
6. **Load Deserialization**: `[CreativeCanvas.fromJson] Deserialized X drawings`
7. **Widget Update**: `[CreativeCanvasWidget] Drawings count changed...`
8. **Painting**: `[CanvasPainter] Painting X drawings`

## Potential Issues to Watch For
1. **Serialization Gap**: Drawings saved but not serialized properly
2. **Deserialization Gap**: Drawings serialized but not deserialized properly
3. **Widget Update Gap**: Drawings loaded but widget not rebuilding
4. **Paint Gap**: Drawings in data but not being painted

## Fix Strategy
Based on the log output, we can identify exactly where in the pipeline the drawings are being lost and implement targeted fixes.
