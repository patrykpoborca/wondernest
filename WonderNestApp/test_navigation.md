# Navigation Test Instructions

## Test Navigation Flow

1. **Welcome Screen** (should appear on app launch)
   - Verify you see "WonderNest" title
   - Verify you see "Get Started" button
   - Verify you see "Sign In" button

2. **Test Get Started Button**
   - Click "Get Started" button
   - Should navigate to Signup Screen (/signup)
   - Should see signup form

3. **Test Sign In Button**
   - Go back to Welcome screen
   - Click "Sign In" button  
   - Should navigate to Login Screen (/login)
   - Should see login form

## Expected Results
- Navigation from Welcome → Signup works
- Navigation from Welcome → Login works
- No infinite redirect loops
- App stays on auth screens without redirecting to child-home

## Current Fix Applied
- Changed initialLocation from '/child-home' to '/welcome'
- Fixed redirect logic to allow auth routes without redirection
- Auth routes: ['/welcome', '/signup', '/login', '/onboarding']
