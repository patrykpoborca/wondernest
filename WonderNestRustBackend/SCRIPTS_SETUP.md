# 🚀 WonderNest Test Scripts Setup Complete

## ✅ What We've Created

### 📁 Organized Scripts Directory
All scripts are now organized in the `/scripts` folder for better maintainability.

### 🧪 Comprehensive Test Runner
**Main Script: `scripts/run_all_tests.sh`**
- Runs ALL test categories in sequence
- Beautiful colored output with progress tracking
- Prerequisites checking (Rust, Docker, PostgreSQL)
- Test environment setup (Docker containers)
- Comprehensive test execution:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Security tests
  - COPPA compliance tests
  - Concurrency tests
  - Live endpoint tests
- Coverage report generation
- Detailed summary with pass/fail counts
- Execution time tracking

### ⚡ Quick Test Runner
**Script: `scripts/test_quick.sh`**
- Fast unit tests only
- Perfect for development workflow
- No coverage overhead

### 🐳 Docker Management Scripts
- `rebuild-docker.sh` - Full rebuild with health checks
- `quick-rebuild.sh` - Fast cached rebuild
- `restart-docker.sh` - Container restart
- `docker-status.sh` - Status monitoring
- `docker-logs.sh` - Log viewing

### 🔐 Authentication Test Scripts
- `test-auth-rust.sh` - Live Rust backend testing (port 8082)
- `test-auth.sh` - Legacy Kotlin backend testing (port 8080)

### 🛠️ Convenience Tools
**Makefile** - Easy command access:
```bash
make test           # Run all tests
make test-quick     # Quick tests
make test-security  # Security tests only
make test-coppa     # COPPA compliance tests
make coverage       # Generate coverage report
make docker-build   # Build Docker containers
make lint          # Run linter
make fmt           # Format code
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Run Complete Test Suite
