- **Phase 1 MVP**: Focus on core authentication, RBAC, and invitation system

### Testing
- Planning: Comprehensive test strategy defined in implementation_todo.md
- Result: Documentation complete, ready for implementation

### Next Steps
- Create admin authentication middleware for API endpoints
- Implement admin API route handlers
- Create admin dashboard service for metrics
- Design Flutter admin portal interface
- Implement admin invitation email service
- Add MFA (TOTP) implementation for enhanced security

- Admin authentication system with separate credentials
- 5-tier role-based access control (RBAC)
- Admin invitation system with email verification
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance
- Basic dashboard with essential metrics
- Complete API foundation for admin operations

### Security Considerations Documented
- Multi-factor authentication requirement
- IP-based access restrictions per role
- Session security with automatic timeout
- Tamper-evident audit trails

- Complete isolation from family user authentication

### Compliance Framework Established
- COPPA compliance monitoring and reporting
- Audit log retention and export capabilities
