## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL STRATEGY

### Architecture Principles
1. **Security by Design**: Every feature designed with security as primary concern
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between admin and family systems
3. **Performance Isolation**: Admin operations never impact main application
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Every action logged for compliance and debugging
5. **Type Safety**: Rust's type system prevents entire categories of bugs

### Integration Strategy
- **Existing Patterns**: Follow WonderNest conventions for consistency
- **Axum Integration**: Use existing middleware and routing patterns
- **Database Consistency**: Follow established schema and naming conventions
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses across all admin endpoints
- **Testing Standards**: Match existing test coverage and quality standards

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum + SQLx (matching main application)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with admin-specific schema
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based claims
- **Security**: bcrypt, TOTP ready, IP restrictions
- **Frontend**: Flutter Web (consistent with mobile app)
- **Email**: Integration with existing email service
