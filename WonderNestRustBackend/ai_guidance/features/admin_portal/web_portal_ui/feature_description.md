- Centralized API error handling and user messaging
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Fallback UI states for service unavailability

### Authentication Integration

#### JWT Token Management
```typescript
// Automatic token refresh and secure storage
class AdminAuthService {
  private accessToken: string | null = null;
  private refreshToken: string | null = null;
  
  async login(credentials: LoginCredentials): Promise<AdminUser> {
    // Secure authentication flow
  }
  
  async refreshAccessToken(): Promise<string> {
    // Automatic token refresh
  }
  
  isAuthenticated(): boolean {
    // Check token validity
  }
}
```

#### Role-Based Component Rendering
```typescript
// Conditional rendering based on admin permissions
function AdminComponent({ requiredPermission }: { requiredPermission: string }) {
  const { hasPermission } = useAdminAuth();
  
  if (!hasPermission(requiredPermission)) {
    return <UnauthorizedMessage />;
  }
  
  return <AdminInterface />;
}
```
