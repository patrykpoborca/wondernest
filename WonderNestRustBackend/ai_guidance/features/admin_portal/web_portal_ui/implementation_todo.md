## ðŸš« RISKS & MITIGATION

### Technical Risks
- **Backend API Delays**: Frontend development blocked by incomplete APIs
  - *Mitigation*: Use MSW for API mocking during development
- **Performance Issues**: Dashboard becomes slow with large datasets
  - *Mitigation*: Implement virtualization and pagination from start
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: XSS or authentication bypass issues
  - *Mitigation*: Security-first development and comprehensive testing

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Feature requests expanding beyond planned scope
  - *Mitigation*: Clear requirements documentation and change control
- **Integration Complexity**: API integration more complex than expected
  - *Mitigation*: Start with simple endpoints and build complexity gradually
- **Testing Delays**: Comprehensive testing taking longer than planned
  - *Mitigation*: Write tests alongside development, not after

### Resource Risks
- **Developer Availability**: Key developer unavailability affecting timeline
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive documentation and code reviews
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: External service changes affecting integration
  - *Mitigation*: Minimize external dependencies and create fallbacks
