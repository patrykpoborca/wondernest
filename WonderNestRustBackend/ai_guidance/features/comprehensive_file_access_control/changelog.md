# Changelog: Comprehensive File Access Control System

## [2025-09-06 05:15] - Type: FEATURE PLANNING

### Summary
Planned comprehensive file access control system to handle public/private file permissions with proper security and information leakage prevention

### Problem Analysis
Current file access system has several security and usability gaps:
1. **Mixed Access Patterns**: Public files need public access, private files need family-only access
2. **Permission Confusion**: Unclear who can edit/delete files vs who can view them
3. **Information Leakage Risk**: Private files could reveal existence to unauthorized users
4. **Frontend Complexity**: Different URL patterns needed based on file visibility and user permissions

### Business Requirements Identified
1. **Public Files**: Anyone can view, only owner can edit/delete
2. **Private Files**: Only family members can view, only owner can edit/delete  
3. **Information Security**: No leakage about private file existence to unauthorized users
4. **Owner Rights**: File owners always retain edit/delete permissions regardless of visibility

### Planning Documents Created

#### ✅ Feature Description (`feature_description.md`)
- Complete business rules and permission matrix
- User stories for different user types
- Technical requirements and security considerations
- COPPA compliance requirements
- Performance considerations

#### ✅ Implementation Todo (`implementation_todo.md`) 
- 7-phase implementation plan with 50+ specific tasks
- Security-focused approach with information leakage prevention
- Frontend integration requirements
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

#### ✅ API Specification (`api_endpoints.md`)
- 6 distinct endpoints with clear access control
- Detailed request/response formats
- Security headers and rate limiting
- Error handling without information leakage
- Frontend integration examples

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### Access Control Strategy
```
Public Files: /api/v1/files/{id}/public (no auth)
Private Files: /api/v1/files/{id}/family (auth + family check)  
Owner Operations: Standard endpoints with ownership validation
```

#### Security Approach
- **404 (not 403)** for private files accessed by unauthorized users
- JWT validation on all authenticated endpoints
- Family membership verification via database queries
- Rate limiting on public endpoints
- Comprehensive audit logging

#### Permission Matrix
| Action | Public File | Private File | Auth Required | Owner Required |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| View   | Anyone      | Family only  | Private: Yes  | No             |
| Edit   | Owner only  | Owner only   | Yes           | Yes            |
| Delete | Owner only  | Owner only   | Yes           | Yes            |

### Implementation Complexity Assessment
- **Level**: HIGH
- **Security Priority**: CRITICAL  
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 weeks
- **Main Risks**: Information leakage, performance impact, frontend complexity

### Next Steps Prioritized
1. **Phase 1**: Backend API restructuring and access control functions
2. **Phase 2**: Database optimizations and enhanced models
3. **Phase 3**: Security implementation with information leakage prevention
4. **Phase 4**: Frontend integration and testing
5. **Phase 5**: Comprehensive security and integration testing

### Dependencies Identified
- Database indexes for family membership queries
- Rate limiting infrastructure
- Frontend component updates for permission-based UI
- Security testing framework enhancements

### Success Criteria Defined
- **Security**: No information leakage about private files to unauthorized users
- **Functionality**: Public files accessible without auth, family files restricted properly
- **Performance**: No significant degradation from access control checks
- **Usability**: Clear error messages and appropriate URL patterns

## [2025-09-06 05:25] - Type: FEATURE ENHANCEMENT

### Summary
Enhanced file access control planning to include comprehensive multi-account family support

### Problem Identified
Initial planning focused on single-user family access but WonderNest actually supports multiple user accounts per family. The database already has:
- `family.families` table for family entities
- `family.family_members` table supporting multiple users per family with roles
- Need to leverage this existing infrastructure for comprehensive file access control

### Enhancements Made

#### ✅ Updated Feature Description (`feature_description.md`)
- Added multi-account family architecture section
- Enhanced permission matrix to include family member access patterns
- Added family account scenarios (Parent A/Parent B examples)
- Updated user stories for multi-account family members

#### ✅ Updated Implementation Todo (`implementation_todo.md`)
- Enhanced access control functions with family membership checking
- Added multi-account database optimization considerations
- Updated models to include family member information and relationships
- Enhanced frontend components to show file ownership across family accounts
- Added filter options for "My Files" vs "Family Files" vs "All Files"

#### ✅ Updated API Specification (`api_endpoints.md`)
- Enhanced `/family` endpoint description with multi-account support
- Added `owner_name` and `relationship` fields to file responses
- Added `owner_filter` query parameter for file listing
- Updated examples to show family member file access scenarios

### Multi-Account Family Architecture

#### Database Schema Leverage
```sql
family.families (id, name, created_by, created_at)
family.family_members (id, family_id, user_id, role, joined_at)
```

#### Permission Model
- **File Owner**: Can edit/delete regardless of family relationships
- **Family Members**: Can view private files from other family members
- **Public Files**: Anyone can view, only owner can edit/delete
- **Information Leakage Prevention**: Private files return 404 to non-family members

#### API Response Enhancements
```json
{
  "owner_name": "Jane Smith",
  "is_owner": false,
  "relationship": "spouse",
  "permissions": {
    "can_view": true,
    "can_edit": false,
    "can_delete": false
  }
}
```

### Frontend UX Improvements
- Show uploader name for family files
- Family member avatars/badges
- Filter options: My Files | Family Files | All Files
- Clear ownership indicators
- Disabled edit/delete buttons for non-owned files

### Implementation Complexity Updates
- **Database Queries**: Family membership verification via JOIN operations
- **Response Models**: Enhanced with owner information and family relationships
- **Frontend State**: Managing multi-account file ownership and permissions
- **Testing Scenarios**: Multiple family configurations and edge cases
