# Implementation Todo: Comprehensive File Access Control System

## Pre-Implementation Analysis
- [x] Review current file access implementation
- [x] Identify security gaps and information leakage risks
- [x] Document business rules and permission matrix
- [x] Create comprehensive feature specification

## Phase 1: Backend API Restructuring

### 1.1 Route Organization
- [ ] Audit current file routes and their access patterns
- [ ] Restructure routes to separate public, family, and owner-only endpoints
- [ ] Remove family endpoint from auth middleware (already done)
- [ ] Ensure public endpoint has no auth requirements

### 1.2 Access Control Functions (Multi-Account Family Support)
- [ ] Create `FileAccessController` service for centralized permission logic
- [ ] Implement `can_view_file(user_id, file_id) -> bool` with family membership checking
- [ ] Implement `can_edit_file(user_id, file_id) -> bool` (owner only, regardless of family)
- [ ] Implement `can_delete_file(user_id, file_id) -> bool` (owner only, regardless of family)
- [ ] Implement `get_family_members(user_id) -> Vec<Uuid>` for family membership queries
- [ ] Implement `are_family_members(user1_id, user2_id) -> bool` for relationship verification
- [ ] Implement `get_appropriate_file_url(user_id, file) -> String`
- [ ] Add family member role checking (admin vs member permissions if needed)

### 1.3 Enhanced File Operations
- [ ] Create `PUT /api/v1/files/{id}` endpoint for metadata updates
- [ ] Create `PATCH /api/v1/files/{id}/visibility` endpoint for public/private toggle
- [ ] Enhance existing DELETE endpoint with proper owner validation
- [ ] Add owner validation to all modification operations

### 1.4 Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement information leakage prevention (404 instead of 403 for private files)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to public endpoints
- [ ] Enhance error responses to prevent information disclosure
- [ ] Add audit logging for file access attempts

## Phase 2: Database and Models

### 2.1 Database Optimizations (Multi-Account Family)
- [ ] Verify existing indexes on `family.family_members` table are sufficient
- [ ] Add composite indexes for family membership + file access queries if needed
- [ ] Add indexes for file ownership queries
- [ ] Review query performance for multi-account family access control checks
- [ ] Consider caching family membership data for frequently accessed relationships
- [ ] Optimize queries for listing files across multiple family member accounts

### 2.2 Model Enhancements (Multi-Account Support)
- [ ] Create `FileAccessRequest` model for permission checking with family context
- [ ] Create `FilePermissions` model for structured permission responses
- [ ] Create `FamilyMember` model for representing family relationships
- [ ] Enhance `FileListResponse` to include owner information and family member names
- [ ] Create `FileVisibilityUpdate` model for PATCH operations
- [ ] Add `uploaded_by_name` or similar to file responses for multi-account clarity

## Phase 3: Frontend Integration

### 3.1 FileManager Component Updates (Multi-Account Family)
- [ ] Update file URL generation based on file visibility and user permissions
- [ ] Add ownership indicators in file listings (show uploader name for family files)
- [ ] Add family member avatars/names to indicate who uploaded each file
- [ ] Add visibility toggle for owned files only
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for permission failures
- [ ] Show "Family" badge for files uploaded by other family members
- [ ] Filter options: "My Files" vs "Family Files" vs "All Files"

### 3.2 Upload Component Updates  
- [ ] Add visibility selection (public/private) to upload form
- [ ] Set appropriate default visibility based on category
- [ ] Add tooltip/help text explaining public vs private access
- [ ] Update upload success handling with new URL patterns

### 3.3 File Actions Updates
- [ ] Restrict edit actions to file owners only
- [ ] Restrict delete actions to file owners only
- [ ] Add visibility toggle action for owners
- [ ] Update action button states based on permissions

## Phase 4: API Endpoint Implementation

### 4.1 Public Access Endpoint
- [ ] Implement GET `/api/v1/files/{id}/public`
- [ ] No authentication required
- [ ] Only serve files where `is_public = true`
- [ ] Return 404 for private files (no information leakage)
- [ ] Add proper caching headers for public files
- [ ] Add rate limiting

### 4.2 Family Access Endpoint  
- [ ] Enhance existing GET `/api/v1/files/{id}/family`
- [ ] Require JWT authentication (already implemented)
- [ ] Verify family membership for private files
- [ ] Allow access to public files by family members
- [ ] Return 404 for non-existent or non-accessible files

### 4.3 Owner-Only Endpoints
- [ ] Implement PUT `/api/v1/files/{id}` (metadata updates)
- [ ] Implement PATCH `/api/v1/files/{id}/visibility` (public/private toggle)  
- [ ] Enhance DELETE `/api/v1/files/{id}` with owner validation
- [ ] Add proper owner verification to all endpoints
- [ ] Return 403 for authenticated non-owners, 401 for unauthenticated

### 4.4 File Listing Enhancements
- [ ] Update GET `/api/v1/files` to include permission information
- [ ] Add `can_edit`, `can_delete`, `can_change_visibility` flags to responses
- [ ] Include appropriate access URL for each file
- [ ] Filter files based on user's access permissions

## Phase 5: Security Implementation

### 5.1 Information Leakage Prevention
- [ ] Audit all error responses for information disclosure
- [ ] Implement consistent 404 responses for private files accessed by unauthorized users
- [ ] Ensure error messages don't reveal family relationships
- [ ] Add security headers to all file responses

### 5.2 Access Control Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test cases for all permission scenarios
- [ ] Test public file access without authentication
- [ ] Test family file access with various family configurations
- [ ] Test owner-only operations with different user types
- [ ] Test information leakage prevention

### 5.3 Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on public endpoints
- [ ] Add request logging for security monitoring  
- [ ] Consider implementing file access tokens for extra security

- [ ] Test upload with public/private selection
- [ ] Test file actions based on ownership
- [ ] Test error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Test URL generation for different file types

## Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment

### 7.1 API Documentation

- [ ] Create permission matrix documentation
- [ ] Document error response codes and meanings
- [ ] Create integration examples for frontend developers

### 7.2 Migration and Rollout
- [ ] Create migration plan for existing files
- [ ] Update existing file URLs if needed
- [ ] Plan phased rollout to minimize disruption
- [ ] Create rollback plan if issues arise

## Success Metrics

### Security Metrics
- [ ] No information leakage about private files to unauthorized users
- [ ] All file modification operations require proper ownership
- [ ] Family access properly restricted to family members
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse of public endpoints

### Functionality Metrics
- [ ] Public files accessible without authentication
- [ ] Family members can access private files of other family members
- [ ] File owners can control visibility and perform all operations
- [ ] Clear error messages guide users appropriately

### Performance Metrics  
- [ ] Family membership queries perform within acceptable limits
- [ ] Public file access is fast and cacheable
- [ ] No significant performance regression from access control checks

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Information Leakage**: Must ensure private files never leak existence to unauthorized users
- **Performance Impact**: Family membership queries could slow down file access
- **Frontend Complexity**: Multiple URL patterns and permission states increase complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive security testing for information leakage
- Database indexing and query optimization for performance
- Clear documentation and examples for frontend integration
- Phased rollout with ability to rollback

## Dependencies
- Database indexes for family relationships
