# Implementation Todo: Content-Aware File Deletion

## Pre-Implementation
- [x] Review business requirements
- [x] Check existing database schema for file references
- [x] Identify content types that reference files
- [ ] Design enhanced file operation response structure
- [ ] Plan database schema updates

## Database Schema Updates
- [ ] Add detachment tracking columns to uploaded_files
- [ ] Create indexes for orphaned file queries
- [ ] Add audit trail columns
- [ ] Create migration scripts
- [ ] Test migration on development database

## Backend Implementation
### Phase 1: Reference Detection System
- [ ] Create FileReferenceService for checking file usage
- [ ] Implement reference counting queries
- [ ] Add support for different reference types (stories, games, profiles)
- [ ] Create reference validation logic
- [ ] Write unit tests for reference detection

### Phase 2: Enhanced Deletion Logic
- [ ] Update FileOperationResponse model
- [ ] Implement FileOperation enum
- [ ] Create smart deletion decision logic
- [ ] Update delete_file function with reference checking
- [ ] Add detachment workflow instead of deletion
- [ ] Implement audit logging

### Phase 3: API Updates
- [ ] Update DELETE /api/v1/files/{id} endpoint
- [ ] Add batch deletion endpoint
- [ ] Update response format with operation details
- [ ] Add warning endpoints for files about to be deleted
- [ ] Update OpenAPI documentation

### Phase 4: Cleanup System
- [ ] Create orphaned file cleanup job
- [ ] Implement background task scheduler
- [ ] Add cleanup metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Create admin endpoints for file management
- [ ] Add configuration for cleanup policies

## Models and Structs
### New Response Models
- [ ] FileOperationResponse struct
- [ ] FileOperation enum
- [ ] FileReference struct
- [ ] FileOperationResult struct

### Updated Models
- [ ] Update UploadedFile model with detachment fields
- [ ] Add reference counting fields
- [ ] Update error types for deletion scenarios

## Services Implementation
- [ ] Create FileReferenceService
- [ ] Update FileService with smart deletion
- [ ] Create FileCleanupService
- [ ] Add FileAuditService
- [ ] Create FileAnalyticsService

## Database Queries
- [ ] Reference counting queries
- [ ] Orphaned file detection queries
- [ ] Batch update queries for detachment
- [ ] Audit trail queries
- [ ] Cleanup candidate queries

## Error Handling
- [ ] Add specific error types for file operations
- [ ] Handle concurrent deletion scenarios
- [ ] Add proper rollback logic
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Add validation for edge cases

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test reference detection logic
- [ ] Test deletion decision algorithms
- [ ] Test detachment workflows
- [ ] Test cleanup job logic
- [ ] Test error scenarios

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test full deletion workflows
- [ ] Test API endpoint responses
- [ ] Test database consistency
- [ ] Test concurrent operations
- [ ] Test cleanup job execution

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test user upload and deletion flows
- [ ] Test story creation with file references
- [ ] Test file deletion with active references
- [ ] Test orphaned file cleanup
- [ ] Test admin file management

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create deployment guide for schema changes
- [ ] Document new configuration options
- [ ] Update troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Create migration runbook

## Configuration
- [ ] Add cleanup job scheduling config
- [ ] Add reference checking timeout config
- [ ] Add storage retention policies
- [ ] Add audit log retention config
- [ ] Add performance tuning options

## Monitoring and Metrics
- [ ] Add deletion operation metrics
- [ ] Track reference counting performance
- [ ] Monitor orphaned file growth
- [ ] Alert on broken references
- [ ] Track storage usage patterns

## Security and Compliance
- [ ] Verify COPPA compliance for child file handling
- [ ] Add authorization checks for all operations
- [ ] Implement audit logging for compliance
- [ ] Add data retention policy enforcement
- [ ] Test edge cases for security vulnerabilities

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize reference counting queries
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed references
- [ ] Implement batch processing for cleanup
- [ ] Add query result pagination
- [ ] Profile deletion operation performance

## Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Create database migration scripts
- [ ] Prepare rollback procedures
- [ ] Create configuration templates
- [ ] Prepare monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Create deployment checklist

## Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Validate data integrity
- [ ] Check audit log accuracy
- [ ] Verify cleanup job execution
- [ ] Collect user feedback

## Known Edge Cases to Handle
1. Files referenced by deleted content
2. Circular reference scenarios
3. Concurrent deletion attempts
4. References to non-existent files
5. User deletion while files are referenced
6. System files that should never be deleted
7. Files with mixed ownership (family shared)
8. Large batch operations
9. Storage backend failures during deletion
10. Database transaction failures

## Success Criteria
- [ ] No broken content after file deletion
- [ ] Clear user feedback on operation results
- [ ] Efficient reference checking (< 100ms)
- [ ] Proper audit trail for all operations
- [ ] Successful orphaned file cleanup
- [ ] Zero data loss incidents
- [ ] Maintained storage efficiency
- [ ] COPPA compliance maintained
