- **Modular Service Architecture**: Each creator function has dedicated service methods
- **Database Optimization**: Comprehensive indexing for high-volume operations
- **Revenue Tier System**: Automatic tier progression based on performance metrics
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all creator actions for compliance

#### Integration Patterns
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing family auth system unchanged
- **Clean Separation**: Creator routes mounted at distinct API paths
- **Error Handling**: Unified error system with creator-specific error types
- **Type Safety**: Full Rust type checking for all creator operations

### Next Steps for Development Team

### Database Migration Notes
- **Schema**: Creates new `creators` schema - requires database user permissions
- **Size Impact**: Initial migration creates 12 new tables with comprehensive structure
- **Rollback**: Migration includes verification steps but rollback requires manual schema drop
- **Performance**: Migration includes index creation - may take time on large systems

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Apply migration
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U wondernest_app -d wondernest_prod -f migrations/0009_creator_platform_foundation.sql

# Set creator JWT secret
export CREATOR_JWT_SECRET="your-creator-jwt-secret-key"

# Verify compilation
cargo check

# Run with creator routes active
cargo run --bin wondernest-backend
```
