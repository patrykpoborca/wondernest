### Key Architectural Decisions

#### Technical Architecture
- **Plugin-Based Integration**: Extended existing GamePlugin interface with ContentAwareGamePlugin
- **Privacy-First Design**: Age-agnostic privacy protection assuming all users under 13
- **Educational Focus**: Achievement-based content unlocks rather than commercial discovery
- **Offline-First**: Comprehensive caching and offline content access
- **Secure Asset Delivery**: Signed URLs with expiration for all content assets

#### Child Experience Design
- **Magical Discovery**: Sparkle animations and celebration effects for content unlocks
- **Educational Framing**: Content presented as "learning adventures" not products
- **Achievement Integration**: Content unlocks through educational milestones
- **Parent Dependency**: All content access requires explicit parental approval
- **Natural Progression**: Content feels like game progression, not external purchases

#### COPPA Compliance Strategy
- **Verifiable Parental Consent**: Multi-factor parent verification with digital signatures
- **Data Minimization**: Only educational progress data collection with automatic deletion
- **Comprehensive Audit Trails**: Complete interaction logging with anonymization
- **Transparent Privacy Controls**: Parent dashboard for data management and deletion
- **Automated Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous COPPA compliance verification
