# Game-Marketplace Integration System

## Overview
The Game-Marketplace Integration System creates seamless bridges between WonderNest's educational games and the marketplace content ecosystem. This system enables games to discover, access, and integrate marketplace content packs while maintaining strict COPPA compliance and child-focused user experiences.

## Business Value

- **Parent Trust**: Transparent content management with clear educational value propositions
