## Phase 1: Foundation & Security (Weeks 1-4)

### Objectives
- Establish secure, COPPA-compliant backend infrastructure
- Create basic content discovery APIs
- Implement core safety and privacy protections
- Set up comprehensive audit and logging systems

### Week 1: Backend Infrastructure
**Core API Development**
```rust
// Rust backend endpoints to implement
pub mod content_discovery {
    // GET /api/v1/content/child/{child_id}/available
    // POST /api/v1/content/child/{child_id}/request-access
    // GET /api/v1/content/child/{child_id}/library
    // GET /api/v1/content/pack/{content_id}/manifest
}

pub mod parental_consent {
    // POST /api/v1/consent/request
    // PUT /api/v1/consent/{consent_id}/decision
    // GET /api/v1/consent/child/{child_id}/status
    // DELETE /api/v1/consent/{consent_id} (COPPA deletion)
}

pub mod audit_trail {
    // POST /api/v1/audit/child-interaction
    // GET /api/v1/audit/parent/{parent_id}/report
    // POST /api/v1/audit/data-deletion-request
}
```

**Database Schema Extensions**
```sql
-- Additional tables for game-marketplace integration
CREATE TABLE game_content_access (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    child_id UUID REFERENCES children(id),
    content_pack_id UUID REFERENCES marketplace_listings(id),
    access_granted_by UUID REFERENCES users(id), -- Parent who approved
    consent_record_id UUID REFERENCES consent_records(id),
    access_granted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    access_expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    access_revoked_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE consent_records (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    child_id UUID REFERENCES children(id),
    content_pack_id UUID REFERENCES marketplace_listings(id),
    consent_method VARCHAR(50),
    parent_email_verified BOOLEAN,
    content_disclosed JSONB,
    privacy_disclosed JSONB,
    educational_assessment JSONB,
    decision VARCHAR(20), -- approved, denied, pending
    decision_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    parent_signature VARCHAR(500),
    consent_expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE child_interaction_audit (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    anonymized_child_id VARCHAR(64), -- Hashed child ID
    interaction_type VARCHAR(100),
    game_context VARCHAR(100),

    pub requires_approval: bool,
    pub max_content_items: u8,
    pub exclude_commercial: bool,
}

impl ContentFilter {
    pub fn coppa_compliant(child_age_months: u16) -> Self {
        Self {
            child_age_months: Some(child_age_months),
            educational_focus_only: true,
            requires_approval: true,
            max_content_items: 10,
            exclude_commercial: true,
        }
    }
}

pub async fn get_child_appropriate_content(
    child_id: &str,
    game_id: &str,
    filter: ContentFilter,
) -> Result<Vec<ContentPack>, ContentError> {
