# Marketplace Library System

## Overview
WonderNest's marketplace library system enables content creators to upload, sell, and distribute educational content packs while providing families with a curated library of purchased content. The system integrates with the file management system to create seamless content delivery and supports applet/game integration.

## Integration Architecture

```
File Upload → Content Pack Service → Marketplace Listing
     ↓                ↓                    ↓
Storage Provider → Signed URLs ← Child Library
     ↓                ↓                    ↓  
Game Plugin API ← Content Access ← Purchase Transaction
```

### Key Integration Points
1. **File Management**: Content packs reference uploaded files via file_references table
2. **Signed URLs**: All content access uses time-limited signed URLs for security
3. **Game Plugins**: Games query child library to determine available content
4. **Payment Flow**: Stripe integration creates purchase transactions and library entries
