- Multipart file upload handling
- File size validation (10MB limit)
- MIME type validation  
- Database persistence for file metadata
- Unique key generation (UUID)
- Basic file listing with filters
- Fixed website API endpoint URLs to use `/api/v1/files/`
- Implemented public download endpoint for images
- Separated public and protected routes

## üöß In Progress
- Testing file upload/download functionality

## üìù Not Started
- Implement MinIOStorageProvider using AWS S3 SDK

  - Magic byte verification
  - COPPA compliance checks
  - Virus scanning integration
- Actual MinIO storage integration
- Presigned URL generation for downloads
- Soft delete implementation

## üîß Configuration Required
- Create initial bucket in MinIO (wondernest-dev)
- Set up proper CORS rules for MinIO
- Configure file size limits
- Set up allowed MIME types list
