Every game is educational but designed to feel like pure fun. Plus, you can add your own approved content from sources like YouTube Kids to personalize the experience.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the progress tracking work?',
      answer: 'We provide gentle, encouraging progress insights that celebrate your child\'s growth. You\'ll receive weekly summaries showing what games they enjoyed, skills they\'re developing, vocabulary growth, and milestones reached. It\'s informative without being overwhelming - just enough to know they\'re learning while having fun.',

    {
      question: 'What happens if I exceed my plan limits?',
      answer: 'If you need more child profiles, you\'ll receive a notification and can easily upgrade your plan. There are no overage fees, and we\'ll work with you to find the best solution for your family.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the dual curation system work?',
      answer: 'Our dual curation combines the best of both worlds: professional educators select high-quality games and stories for our core collection, and you can add your own approved favorites. This means your child gets expert-vetted content plus family favorites you trust. Everything is pre-screened for safety and educational value.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I change or cancel my subscription anytime?',
      answer: 'Yes, you can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription at any time. There are no long-term contracts or cancellation fees. If you cancel, you\'ll still have access until your current billing period ends.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
      answer: 'We accept all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover) and PayPal. All payments are processed securely, and we don\'t store your payment information on our servers.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you offer discounts for educators or multiple families?',
      answer: 'Yes! We offer special pricing for educators, schools, and family groups. Contact our support team for information about bulk discounts and educational institution pricing.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if my child outgrows the content?',
      answer: 'Our content is designed for ages 3-12 with adaptive difficulty levels. As your child grows, the content automatically adjusts to their skill level. We also regularly add new games and stories for older children.',
