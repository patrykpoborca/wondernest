class StoryBuilderAPI {
  async generateStory(prompt: StoryPrompt): Promise<Story>
  async enhanceText(text: string, mode: EnhanceMode): Promise<string>
  async suggestNext(context: StoryContext): Promise<Suggestion[]>
  async validateContent(story: Story): Promise<ValidationResult>
}
```

-- AI-related tracking
ALTER TABLE stories ADD COLUMN ai_assisted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE stories ADD COLUMN ai_generation_params JSONB;
ALTER TABLE story_pages ADD COLUMN ai_suggestions JSONB[];
