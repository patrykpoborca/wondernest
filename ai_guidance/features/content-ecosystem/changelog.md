# Changelog: Content Ecosystem Feature

## [2025-01-08 19:00] - Type: FEATURE

### Summary
Created comprehensive content ecosystem feature documentation for admin content distribution to apps

### Context
User requested a plan for how admin-uploaded content (sticker packs, character images, stories, and future applets) can feed back into the WonderNest ecosystem. Used product-design-strategist agent to create a comprehensive strategy covering content taxonomy, distribution workflows, user experience, scalability, and technical architecture.

### Changes Made
- ✅ Created feature_description.md with complete business requirements
- ✅ Created implementation_todo.md with 12-month phased roadmap
- ✅ Created api_endpoints.md with detailed API specifications
- ✅ Defined content type taxonomy (StickerPack, CharacterPack, Story, Applet)
- ✅ Designed three-tier distribution system (Core, Featured, Marketplace)
- ✅ Specified metadata architecture for COPPA compliance
- ✅ Planned parental control system with approval workflows

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Content Types**: Expandable enum system supporting stickers, characters, stories, and future applets
2. **Distribution Model**: Three-tier system balancing offline capability with marketplace flexibility
3. **Safety First**: Multi-layer moderation with automated and human review
4. **Child-Centric**: Age-appropriate interfaces with different modes for different age groups
5. **Creator Ecosystem**: Revenue-sharing model with tiered creator benefits

### Summary
Phase 1 Complete - Database foundation and API infrastructure for content ecosystem

### Context
Used wondernest-fullstack-specialist agent to implement Phase 1 of the content ecosystem feature, establishing the foundation for content distribution.

### Changes Made
- ✅ Created migration V008 with content versioning and dependency tables
- ✅ Extended ContentType enum in Rust (StickerPack, CharacterPack, StoryTemplate, Applet)
- ✅ Created comprehensive API models in `content_ecosystem.rs`
- ✅ Implemented 8 content distribution API endpoints in `/api/v2/content/*`
- ✅ Added mock data generators for immediate testing
- ✅ Set up versioning with semantic version support
- ✅ Created dependency tracking system (requires, enhances, replaces, extends, bundles)

### Files Modified
| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `/WonderNestRustBackend/migrations/0008_content_ecosystem_foundation.sql` | CREATE | Database schema for versioning and dependencies |
| `/WonderNestRustBackend/src/models/admin_content.rs` | MODIFY | Extended ContentType enum |
| `/WonderNestRustBackend/src/models/content_ecosystem.rs` | CREATE | API models for content distribution |
| `/WonderNestRustBackend/src/routes/v2/content.rs` | CREATE | Content ecosystem API routes |
| `/WonderNestRustBackend/src/routes/v2/mod.rs` | MODIFY | Added content routes to v2 API |

### Testing
- All code compiles successfully with `cargo check`
- Mock APIs return test data for frontend development

### Next Steps
- Phase 2: Admin portal UI enhancements
- Connect APIs to real database queries
- Build child discovery interface

## [2025-01-08 21:00] - Type: IMPLEMENTATION

### Summary
Phase 2 Complete - Admin portal enhancements and database integration

### Context
Continued with wondernest-fullstack-specialist agent to implement Phase 2, focusing on admin portal UI and connecting APIs to the database.

### Changes Made
- ✅ Enhanced admin portal content upload form with new content types
- ✅ Added rich metadata fields (educational goals, themes, categories, difficulty)
- ✅ Implemented chip-based UI for managing tags and keywords
- ✅ Created ContentEcosystemService to bridge v2 APIs to database
- ✅ Connected `/api/v2/content/catalog` to real database queries
- ✅ Integrated signed URL service for secure content delivery
- ✅ Replaced mock data with real marketplace repository queries

### Files Modified
| File | Change Type | Description |
