## Conclusion

This phased approach minimizes risk while maximizing speed to market. By starting with admin seeding, we can populate the marketplace immediately while learning what creators actually need. Each phase builds on the previous, with clear success criteria and decision points.

The key insight: **Don't build the perfect creator platform on day one. Build what gets content into the marketplace fastest, then iterate based on real usage.**

Phase 1 can start immediately with just 2 developers and deliver value in 2 weeks. Everything else can wait.
