# Post Application System Debug

## Overview
Investigation of critical bug in post application system where users receive "already applied" errors when applying to brand new posts, and no notifications are sent to inviters.

## Issue Summary
- **User Report**: Applying to brand new post results in "already applied" error
- **Additional Problem**: Inviter doesn't receive notification when someone applies
- **HTTP Status**: 400 Bad Request
- **Endpoint**: POST /api/v1/posts/07f5aded-4bfe-485c-9958-14b1ad7a0cda/apply

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to apply to posts without getting false "already applied" errors
- As a post creator/inviter, I want to receive notifications when someone applies to my posts
- As a system administrator, I want to track and resolve application failures

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can successfully apply to brand new posts
- [ ] Duplicate application checking works correctly
- [ ] Inviter notifications are sent upon successful applications
- [ ] Proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- [ ] 400 Bad Request errors are eliminated for valid applications

## Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing authentication system
- Must be COPPA compliant
- Must support real-time notifications
- Must handle concurrent applications gracefully

## Security Considerations
- Verify user authentication is working correctly
- Ensure duplicate checking prevents actual duplicate applications
- Validate post existence and access permissions
- Audit logging for failed applications
