# Remaining Todos: Post Application System Debug

## Investigation Complete âœ…

The investigation phase is complete. All findings have been documented in the comprehensive analysis.

## Implementation Required ðŸš§

The following work is needed to resolve the post application bug:

### IMMEDIATE (Hot Fix - 1-2 hours)
- [ ] Add temporary debug route to `/api/v1/posts/{postId}/apply`
- [ ] Return clear "feature not implemented" message instead of confusing 400 error
- [ ] Update frontend to handle "not implemented" response gracefully
- [ ] Notify users that post application feature is under development

### SHORT TERM (1-2 Sprints)
- [ ] Design and create database schema for posts system
- [ ] Implement basic POST /api/v1/posts/{postId}/apply endpoint
- [ ] Add duplicate application checking logic
- [ ] Implement basic post creation endpoints
- [ ] Add email notifications to post creators
- [ ] Create basic error handling and validation
- [ ] Write unit tests for core application logic

### MEDIUM TERM (3-4 Sprints)  
- [ ] Implement full post management API (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Add post categories and filtering
- [ ] Implement application status management (accept/reject)
- [ ] Add real-time notifications (WebSocket/SSE)
- [ ] Create application history and tracking
- [ ] Implement post expiration and cleanup
- [ ] Add application withdrawal functionality
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests

### LONG TERM (5+ Sprints)
- [ ] Integrate with existing marketplace infrastructure
- [ ] Add advanced search and filtering for posts
- [ ] Implement recommendation system for relevant posts
- [ ] Add analytics and reporting for post performance
- [ ] Create reputation system for users
- [ ] Add mobile-optimized application flow
- [ ] Implement advanced notification preferences

## Files That Need Creation

### Backend Implementation
- [ ] `/src/main/kotlin/com/wondernest/api/posts/PostRoutes.kt`
- [ ] `/src/main/kotlin/com/wondernest/services/PostService.kt`
- [ ] `/src/main/kotlin/com/wondernest/services/PostApplicationService.kt`
- [ ] `/src/main/kotlin/com/wondernest/domain/repository/PostRepository.kt`
- [ ] `/src/main/kotlin/com/wondernest/domain/repository/PostApplicationRepository.kt`
- [ ] `/src/main/kotlin/com/wondernest/data/database/table/PostTable.kt`
- [ ] `/src/main/kotlin/com/wondernest/data/database/table/PostApplicationTable.kt`

### Database Migrations
- [ ] `V{next}__Create_Posts_Schema.sql`
- [ ] `V{next+1}__Create_Post_Applications_Table.sql`
- [ ] `V{next+2}__Create_Post_Notifications_Table.sql`

### Testing
- [ ] `/src/test/kotlin/com/wondernest/api/posts/PostRoutesTest.kt`
- [ ] `/src/test/kotlin/com/wondernest/services/PostServiceTest.kt`
- [ ] `/src/test/kotlin/com/wondernest/services/PostApplicationServiceTest.kt`

### Frontend Updates (if needed)
- [ ] Update error handling for post application failures
- [ ] Add user feedback for "feature not implemented" state
- [ ] Implement retry logic for application submissions

## Dependencies to Verify

### Existing Systems That Should Work
- âœ… Authentication system (JWT validation working)
- âœ… User management system
- âœ… Database connection and migrations
- âœ… API routing framework (KTOR)
- âœ… Notification infrastructure (partial)

### Systems That May Need Updates
- [ ] Notification service (verify email/push capability)
- [ ] File upload system (for application attachments)
- [ ] Permission system (post creator vs applicant permissions)

## Testing Strategy Still Needed

### Unit Tests
- [ ] PostService.applyToPost()
- [ ] PostService.checkDuplicateApplication()  
- [ ] PostApplicationService.createApplication()
- [ ] PostApplicationService.notifyCreator()

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Complete post application flow
- [ ] Notification delivery verification
- [ ] Error handling scenarios
- [ ] Concurrent application handling

### Manual Testing
- [ ] End-to-end user application flow
- [ ] Error message clarity and helpfulness
- [ ] Notification delivery timing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

## Documentation Still Needed

- [ ] Update main API documentation with post endpoints
- [ ] Create post application user guide
- [ ] Document notification system behavior
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Success Criteria

The post application system will be considered complete when:

- [ ] Users can successfully apply to posts without errors
- [ ] Duplicate applications are properly prevented with clear messaging
- [ ] Post creators receive notifications when users apply
- [ ] Proper error handling with meaningful messages
- [ ] All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] System handles concurrent applications gracefully
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (<500ms response time)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- Database schema design (affects all functionality)
- Notification system reliability
- Performance under concurrent load

### Medium Risk Items  
- Integration with existing marketplace system
- Mobile frontend updates
- Email deliverability

### Low Risk Items
- Basic CRUD operations
- Authentication integration (already working)
- Logging and monitoring

## Next Action Required

**IMMEDIATE**: Someone should implement the temporary debug route to stop confusing users with misleading error messages. This is a 30-minute fix that will greatly improve user experience while the full feature is being developed.
