# Sticker Book Game

## Overview
A creative digital art game where children can create artwork using drawing tools and pre-made stickers on an infinite canvas. Projects are saved locally and synced across devices, allowing children to build a portfolio of their creative work.

## User Stories
- As a child, I want to draw pictures and add stickers so that I can express my creativity
- As a child, I want to save my projects so that I can continue working on them later
- As a parent, I want to see my child's creative work so that I can track their artistic development
- As a child, I want my projects to sync across devices so that I can work on iPad or phone

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Children can draw with multiple colors and brush sizes

## Business Rules
1. Each child can have unlimited sticker projects
2. Projects are private to the child (parents can view in parent mode)
3. Sticker content must be age-appropriate and pre-approved
4. Projects auto-save every 30 seconds during active editing
5. Deleted projects are soft-deleted for 30 days before permanent removal
6. Maximum project size is 10MB to prevent storage issues

## Technical Constraints
- Must work offline using local storage
- Sync when network is available
- Support iOS, Android, and Desktop platforms

- Thumbnails generated client-side to reduce server load
- JSONB storage in PostgreSQL for flexible schema

## Dependencies
- Depends on: Authentication system, Child profiles
- Required by: Analytics system (for creative metrics)
- Related to: Other creative games in the platform

## UI/UX Considerations
- Mobile-first design with touch interactions
- Large, child-friendly buttons
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Undo/redo functionality
- Pinch-to-zoom on mobile devices
- Landscape orientation preferred for tablets
- Accessibility: High contrast mode option

## Security Considerations
- No user-generated content sharing between children
- Sticker content vetted and stored server-side
- Projects contain no personally identifiable information
- Parent PIN required to delete multiple projects
- COPPA compliant - no external sharing features
