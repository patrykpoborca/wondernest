# Changelog: Story Builder to Flutter Integration

## [2025-09-01 03:00] - Type: IMPLEMENTATION

### Summary
Implemented Flutter models and UI components to support rendering stories from web builder

### Changes Made
- ✅ Created enhanced story models matching web builder structure
- ✅ Added JSON serialization with build_runner
- ✅ Implemented variant selection logic based on child age
- ✅ Created StyledTextBlock widget for Flutter
- ✅ Built enhanced story reader screen with page navigation
- ✅ Created story service for API integration
- ✅ Added mock data for development testing

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `enhanced_story_models.dart` | Complete data models matching web structure |
| `styled_text_block.dart` | Widget to render styled text with variants |
| `enhanced_story_reader_screen.dart` | Full story reading experience |
| `enhanced_story_service.dart` | API integration and data fetching |

### Features Implemented
1. **Text Variant Selection**: Automatically selects appropriate variant based on child age
2. **Rich Text Styling**: Supports backgrounds, gradients, shadows, borders, padding
3. **Absolute Positioning**: Text blocks positioned exactly as designed
4. **Image Support**: Background images and popup images with transformations
5. **Progress Tracking**: Tracks reading time and vocabulary encountered
6. **Mock Data**: Full mock story for testing without backend

### Testing
- Models compile successfully with JSON serialization
- Mock story renders with proper styling
- Variant selection logic works based on age
- Page navigation functions correctly

### Next Steps
1. Test with real backend API
2. Add offline caching support
3. Implement story assignment UI
4. Add vocabulary definition system
5. Create story selection screen update

## [2025-09-01 00:00] - Type: AUDIT

### Summary
Conducted comprehensive audit of story builder implementation for Flutter integration readiness

### Analysis Completed
- ✅ Reviewed web story builder implementation
- ✅ Analyzed Flutter story models and viewer
- ✅ Identified data structure mismatches
- ✅ Documented required backend schema
- ✅ Created implementation plan

### Key Findings
1. **Data Structure Mismatch**: Flutter models use simple text strings while web builder uses complex TextBlock with variants
2. **Missing Variant Support**: Flutter app has no variant selection logic
3. **No Styling Support**: Flutter can't render the rich text styles from web builder
4. **Backend Status Unclear**: API endpoints exist but need testing with new structure
5. **Image Storage Missing**: No clear solution for image upload and CDN

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `feature_description.md` | High-level feature requirements |
| `implementation_audit.md` | Detailed analysis of current state and gaps |
| `implementation_todo.md` | Step-by-step implementation checklist |

### Critical Issues Identified
- **High Priority**: Flutter models incompatible with web builder structure
- **High Priority**: No variant selection logic in Flutter
- **Medium Priority**: Image storage solution needed
- **Medium Priority**: Progress tracking not connected

### Next Steps
1. Update Flutter models to match web builder structure
2. Test backend API with new story format
3. Implement story viewer with variant support
4. Add progress tracking integration

### Estimated Effort
- Model Updates: 2-3 hours
- Backend Integration: 3-4 hours
- Flutter Viewer: 6-8 hours
- Testing & Polish: 4-5 hours
- **Total: 15-20 hours**

### Dependencies
- Backend must support new story structure
- Image storage solution must be decided
- Database schema may need updates

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Backend schema changes may affect existing data
- **Medium Risk**: Performance with large stories unknown
- **Low Risk**: Variant selection logic already proven in web

### Recommendations
1. Start with Flutter model updates (blocking everything else)
2. Test backend early to identify issues
3. Build MVP story viewer first, add styling later
4. Consider phased rollout with feature flag
