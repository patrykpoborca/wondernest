# Story Builder to Flutter Integration

## Overview
Enable stories created in the web-based story builder to be viewable and playable in the Flutter mobile application, with proper variant selection based on child age and profile.

## User Stories
- As a parent, I want to create stories on the web and have them immediately available in the mobile app
- As a child, I want to read stories that are appropriate for my age level
- As a parent, I want to see which stories I've created and assign them to specific children

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Stories created in web builder are saved to backend database
- [ ] Flutter app can fetch and display published stories
- [ ] Text variants are selected based on child's age
- [ ] Images and backgrounds are properly loaded
- [ ] Story progress is tracked per child
- [ ] Offline support for downloaded stories

## Technical Constraints
- Must work offline once story is downloaded
- Must be COPPA compliant
- Must support iOS/Android/Desktop
- Images must be cached locally
- Must handle large story files efficiently

## Security Considerations
- Stories must be associated with family accounts
- Only authorized family members can access stories
- Child profiles cannot create/edit stories
- Content filtering must be applied
