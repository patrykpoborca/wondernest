### Files Modified
| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `/ai_guidance/features/story-builder/feature_description.md` | CREATE | Complete feature requirements and user stories |
| `/ai_guidance/features/story-builder/implementation_todo.md` | CREATE | Detailed implementation checklist |
| `/ai_guidance/features/story-builder/api_endpoints.md` | CREATE | Full API documentation with examples |
| `/ai_guidance/features/story-builder/changelog.md` | CREATE | Feature changelog tracking |

### Architecture Decisions
- Stories stored as JSONB in PostgreSQL for flexibility
- Text variants stored within story content for easy retrieval
- Image assets managed separately with CDN delivery planned
- Draft auto-save using Redux state with backend sync
- Preview generation as temporary URLs for security

### Key Design Elements
1. **Editor Layout**: Split-panel design with page navigator and canvas
2. **Text Variants**: Three difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
3. **Publishing Model**: Private to own children first, marketplace later
4. **Asset Management**: Curated library + custom uploads
5. **Analytics**: Built-in engagement tracking from day one

### Testing
- Not yet implemented - planning phase only
- Will require unit tests for validation logic
- Integration tests for full story flow
- E2E tests for publish → app consumption

### Next Steps
1. Create database migration V18__Add_Story_Builder_Tables.sql
2. Build basic story editor UI skeleton
3. Implement draft CRUD operations
4. Add page management functionality
5. Integrate rich text editor
6. Build preview system
7. Implement publishing workflow
