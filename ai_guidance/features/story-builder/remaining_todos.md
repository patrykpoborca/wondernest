## 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### Current Limitations
- Mock API data only - no backend persistence
- Image library uses placeholder images
- No text-to-speech preview capability
- Publishing workflow incomplete (UI only)
- No unit tests implemented yet

### Technical Debt
- Bundle size optimization needed (896KB currently)
- Some components could use React.memo for performance
- Error boundaries could be more comprehensive
- Drag-and-drop could be improved with better visual feedback

## 📋 TESTING STATUS

### Completed
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Vite build successful
- ✅ Development server running
- ✅ Basic component rendering verified

### Pending
- ⚠️ Manual UI testing in browser needed
- ⚠️ Cross-browser compatibility testing
- ⚠️ Responsive design testing on mobile/tablet
- ⚠️ User flow testing (create → edit → save)
- ⚠️ Error handling and edge case testing

## 🔗 INTEGRATION STATUS

### Completed Integrations
- ✅ Authentication system (parent login required)
- ✅ Routing with protected routes
- ✅ Parent dashboard navigation
- ✅ Redux store integration
- ✅ Material-UI theming

### Pending Integrations  
- ⚠️ Backend API (using mocks currently)
- ⚠️ File upload system for custom images
- ⚠️ Flutter app synchronization (not in current scope)
- ⚠️ Analytics tracking integration
- ⚠️ Push notification system for published stories

## 📝 NOTES

### Architecture Decisions Made
- Redux Toolkit chosen for predictable state management
- RTK Query used for API integration with caching
- Material-UI provides consistent design system
- Mock API enables immediate development and testing
- TypeScript ensures compile-time error prevention

### Development Approach
- Mobile-first responsive design implemented
- Component-based architecture for reusability  
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Auto-save prevents data loss during editing
- Modular file structure enables team collaboration

### Future Considerations
- Consider React Query as RTK Query alternative for complex caching
- Implement proper image optimization and CDN integration
- Plan for offline editing capabilities
- Design for scalability with thousands of stories per user
- Consider internationalization for global markets
