# UI Mockup Prompt: Child's Story Library Interface

## Project Context
You are designing the child-facing story library for WonderNest's Story Adventure feature. This is where children (ages 3-12) browse and select stories to read from their personal library. The marketplace is accessible ONLY through parental PIN/authentication. The interface must be extremely child-friendly, intuitive, and safe.

## Design Requirements

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Children ages 3-12 (consider different developmental stages)
- **Key segments**: 
  - Early readers (3-5): Picture-heavy, minimal text
  - Emerging readers (6-8): Balance of images and text
  - Independent readers (9-12): More text-focused but still playful

### Core Functionality

#### 1. Main Library View
The home screen where children see their available stories:

##### Layout Options (child can toggle between):
- **Bookshelf view**: Stories displayed as book spines on wooden shelves
-‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ô**Grid view**: Large cover thumbnails in a grid
- **Carousel view**: Swipeable cards for touch devices

- **COPPA compliant** - no data collection or sharing

### MUST NOT Have:
- **Scary or harsh** error messages
- **Time pressure** or stress-inducing elements

## Notes for Designer
Create an interface that makes children EXCITED to read while giving parents peace of mind. The library should feel like a magical, personal space where every child feels welcome and capable. The parent gate should be secure but not feel like a punishment or barrier - frame it as "grown-up stuff" rather than "forbidden content."

Remember: Children will use this when they're tired, excited, frustrated, or happy. The interface must work in all emotional states and never make a child feel stupid or incapable. Every interaction should feel like play, not work.
