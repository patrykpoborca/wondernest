# UI Mockup Prompt: Story Adventure Marketplace

## Project Context
You are designing the UI for a children's educational app marketplace where parents and educators can buy, sell, and share interactive story templates. This is part of WonderNest, a COPPA-compliant child development platform. The marketplace must be parent-facing (not child-facing) and integrate with the existing app's design language.

## Design Requirements

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Parents (ages 28-45) browsing/purchasing stories for children ages 3-12
- **Secondary**: Educators and content creators selling story templates
- **Tertiary**: School administrators purchasing bulk licenses

### Core Functionality to Display

#### 1. Browse/Discovery Section
- **Featured Stories carousel** with large preview cards
- **Category filters**: Age range (3-5, 6-8, 9-12), Subject (Math, Science, Social Skills, Language), Reading Level
- **Search bar** with auto-suggestions
- **Trending/Popular** section
- **New Releases** section
- **Staff Picks** curated collections

#### 2. Story Card Components
Each story listing should show:
- **Cover image** (colorful, child-friendly illustration)
- **Title and author** name
- **Price** (or "FREE" badge)
- **Age range** indicator (visual badge)
- **Vocabulary focus** tags (e.g., "Animals", "Emotions", "Numbers")
- **Rating** (5-star system with review count)
- **Reading time** estimate
- **"Preview" button** for sample pages
- **Quick stats**: Words targeted, reading level, audio available

#### 3. Story Detail Page
When a story is selected, show:
- **Hero image/video** preview
- **Full description** with educational goals
- **Sample pages** carousel (3-5 pages)
- **Vocabulary list** being taught
- **Customization options** preview (show how words/characters can be swapped)
- **Reviews section** with parent testimonials
- **Author profile** link
- **"Add to Library" CTA button**
- **Bundle deals** if available
- **Compatibility badges** (offline available, audio included, etc.)

#### 4. Creator Dashboard
For parents/educators selling stories:
- **Upload interface** with drag-and-drop
- **Pricing tools** with suggested prices
- **Analytics dashboard**: Downloads, revenue, ratings
- **Content moderation status** indicators
- **Withdrawal/payout** section

#### 5. My Library Section
- **Purchased stories** grid view
- **Download status** indicators
- **Filter by**: Child profile, age, subject
- **Offline availability** toggle
- **Re-download** options

### Visual Design Guidelines

#### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Soft, warm colors (avoid harsh contrasts)
- **Background**: Light, calming tones (#F7F9FC, #FFF8F3)
- **Accents**: Playful but not overwhelming (soft blues, greens, oranges)
- **Text**: High contrast for readability (#2C3E50 on light backgrounds)

#### Typography
- **Headers**: Rounded, friendly fonts (like Quicksand or Nunito)
- **Body text**: Clean, readable sans-serif
- **Size**: Larger than typical apps (consider parent eye strain)

#### Components Style
- **Cards**: Rounded corners (8-12px radius), subtle shadows
- **Buttons**: Large touch targets (min 48px), clear CTAs
- **Icons**: Outlined style, friendly and recognizable
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace for clarity

### Mobile-First Responsive Design
Create mockups for:
1. **Mobile** (375px width) - Single column, vertical scrolling
2. **Tablet** (768px width) - 2-3 column grid
3. **Desktop** (1440px width) - Full marketplace experience

### Specific UI Elements to Include

#### Navigation
- **Bottom tab bar** (mobile): Browse, Search, My Library, Create, Profile
- **Side navigation** (tablet/desktop): Expanded categories
- **Breadcrumbs** for deep navigation

#### Interactive Elements
- **Quick preview** on hover/long-press
- **Favorite/wishlist** heart icon
- **Share** functionality (to other parents)
- **Sort options**: Price, Popularity, Newest, Rating
- **Filter chips** that can be easily added/removed

#### Trust & Safety Indicators
- **Verified creator** badges
- **Content rating** (age-appropriate indicators)
- **"Parent Approved"** community badges
- **Educational standards** alignment badges

### Accessibility Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance
- **Large touch targets** (minimum 44x44px)
- **Clear focus indicators**
- **Screen reader** friendly labels
- **High contrast mode** option

### States to Design
1. **Empty states**: No results, first-time user
2. **Loading states**: Skeleton screens while content loads
3. **Error states**: Connection issues, payment failures
4. **Success states**: Purchase confirmation, download complete

### Additional Considerations
- **Parental controls**: PIN/biometric lock for purchases
- **Multi-child support**: Switch between child profiles
- **Offline mode**: Clear indicators of downloadable content
- **Localization ready**: Space for translated text
- **Payment integration**: Smooth checkout flow

## Deliverables Requested
1. **Marketplace home screen** (mobile and desktop versions)
2. **Story detail page** with all elements
3. **Search/filter results** page
4. **Creator upload flow** (3-4 key screens)
5. **Purchase flow** (cart → checkout → confirmation)

## Design Inspiration
Reference these for style direction (but make it unique):
- Epic! Books for Kids (content organization)
- Teachers Pay Teachers (creator marketplace)
- Headspace for Kids (calming, friendly design)
- Khan Academy Kids (educational focus)
- Toca Boca apps (playful but clean aesthetic)

## Important Notes
- **NO** dark patterns or manipulative design
- **NO** auto-play videos or aggressive animations
- **MUST** feel trustworthy and educational-first
- **MUST** be obviously parent-facing, not child-facing
- **CONSIDER** parents using this while tired or distracted
- **INCLUDE** clear pricing with no hidden costs

Create a clean, professional, yet warm and inviting marketplace that parents will trust with their children's education and their payment information. The design should feel premium enough to justify paid content while remaining accessible and friendly.
