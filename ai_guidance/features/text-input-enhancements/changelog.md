# Changelog: Text Input Enhancements

## [2025-08-31 19:40] - Type: REFACTOR

### Summary
Refactored text variant system from difficulty-based to primary/alternate structure per user requirements

### Changes Made
- ✅ Changed variant type from difficulty-based (easy/medium/hard) to primary/alternate
- ✅ Added targetAge field to VariantMetadata for precise age targeting
- ✅ Updated vocabularyDifficulty to use descriptive terms (simple/moderate/advanced/complex)
- ✅ Modified VariantManager UI to support new primary/alternate structure
- ✅ Added target age slider with automatic age range adjustment
- ✅ Enhanced variant display with color-coded difficulty chips
- ✅ Updated StoryCanvas to create text blocks with primary variant by default
- ✅ Implemented backward compatibility for old variant format

### Files Modified
| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `/src/features/story-builder/types/story.ts` | MODIFY | Updated TextVariant interface with type field |

## [2024-12-31 02:50] - Type: FEATURE

### Summary
Implemented comprehensive text styling and variant system for story builder

### Changes Made

- ✅ Created TextStyleEditor component with full styling controls
- ✅ Implemented VariantManager for multi-variant text management
- ✅ Added style preset system with 6 default presets
- ✅ Created style utility functions for CSS generation
- ✅ Built StyledTextBlock component for rendering styled text
- ⚠️ Integration with StoryCanvas pending
- ⚠️ Backend API updates not yet implemented

### Files Modified
| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `/src/features/story-builder/types/story.ts` | MODIFY | Enhanced TextBlock interface with styling and variants |
| `/src/features/story-builder/components/TextStyleEditor.tsx` | CREATE | Full-featured style editor component |
| `/src/features/story-builder/components/VariantManager.tsx` | CREATE | Text variant management interface |
| `/src/features/story-builder/utils/styleUtils.ts` | CREATE | Style generation and validation utilities |
| `/src/features/story-builder/components/StyledTextBlock.tsx` | CREATE | Styled text rendering component |

### Testing
- Tested: Component compilation and TypeScript types
- Result: All components compile without errors
- Pending: Runtime testing with actual story data
- Pending: Cross-browser CSS compatibility testing

### Next Steps
1. Integrate TextStyleEditor into StoryCanvas sidebar
2. Update StoryCanvas to use StyledTextBlock for rendering
3. Add backend API endpoints for saving styled text
4. Implement AI variant generation service
5. Add unit tests for style utilities
6. Create E2E tests for text editing workflow

### Technical Debt
- Need to optimize re-renders when style changes
- Consider using CSS-in-JS library for better performance
- Add style caching mechanism for frequently used presets
- Implement undo/redo for style changes

### Known Issues
- Animation keyframes are injected globally (need scoping)
- Color picker library needs to be installed (react-colorful)
- Gradient editor needs better UX for stop manipulation
- Mobile responsiveness not fully tested

### Dependencies Added
- react-colorful (for color picking) - needs installation
- framer-motion (for animations) - already installed

### Performance Considerations
- Style calculation is memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Animation keyframes are only injected when needed
- Variant selection algorithm is optimized with useMemo
- Consider virtual scrolling for large numbers of variants

### Security Notes
- Text content validation implemented for child safety
- XSS prevention through React's built-in escaping
- Style values are sanitized before application
- Need to add server-side validation for user-generated styles

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels added to all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation supported in style editor
- Screen reader announcements for variant changes
- Color contrast validation needed for text/background combinations

### Migration Notes
- Existing TextBlock data needs migration to new format
- Legacy variants (easy/medium/hard strings) converted to TextVariant objects
- Backward compatibility maintained through optional fields
- Migration utility needed for production deployment
