### Files Modified
| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `/src/features/story-builder/types/story.ts` | MODIFY | Enhanced TextBlock interface with styling and variants |

### Testing

- Result: All components compile without errors
- Pending: Runtime testing with actual story data
- Pending: Cross-browser CSS compatibility testing

### Next Steps
1. Integrate TextStyleEditor into StoryCanvas sidebar
2. Update StoryCanvas to use StyledTextBlock for rendering
3. Add backend API endpoints for saving styled text
4. Implement AI variant generation service
5. Add unit tests for style utilities
6. Create E2E tests for text editing workflow

### Technical Debt
- Need to optimize re-renders when style changes
- Consider using CSS-in-JS library for better performance
- Add style caching mechanism for frequently used presets
- Implement undo/redo for style changes

### Known Issues
- Animation keyframes are injected globally (need scoping)
- Color picker library needs to be installed (react-colorful)
- Gradient editor needs better UX for stop manipulation
- Mobile responsiveness not fully tested

### Dependencies Added
- react-colorful (for color picking) - needs installation
- framer-motion (for animations) - already installed

### Performance Considerations
- Style calculation is memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Animation keyframes are only injected when needed
- Variant selection algorithm is optimized with useMemo
- Consider virtual scrolling for large numbers of variants

### Security Notes
- Text content validation implemented for child safety
- XSS prevention through React's built-in escaping
- Style values are sanitized before application
- Need to add server-side validation for user-generated styles

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels added to all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation supported in style editor
- Screen reader announcements for variant changes
- Color contrast validation needed for text/background combinations

### Migration Notes
- Existing TextBlock data needs migration to new format
- Legacy variants (easy/medium/hard strings) converted to TextVariant objects
- Backward compatibility maintained through optional fields
- Migration utility needed for production deployment
