## Pending Implementation üìù

### Frontend Tasks
1. **StoryCanvas Integration** (High Priority)
   - Add TextStyleEditor to the page editor sidebar
   - Replace TextBlock rendering with StyledTextBlock
   - Add "Add Text" button to canvas toolbar
   - Implement text block selection/deselection

2. **State Management** (High Priority)
   - Update Redux slice to handle style changes
   - Add style history for undo/redo
   - Persist styles in localStorage during editing
   - Add style change debouncing

3. **UX Improvements** (Medium Priority)
   - Add drag handles for text repositioning
   - Implement resize handles for text blocks
   - Add copy/paste for styles between blocks
   - Create style preview in preset selector

4. **Mobile Optimization** (Medium Priority)
   - Test and fix touch interactions
   - Optimize style editor for mobile screens
   - Add responsive breakpoint controls
   - Test gesture controls for text manipulation

### Backend Tasks
1. **API Endpoints** (High Priority)
   - `PUT /api/v2/stories/drafts/{id}/text-blocks`
   - `POST /api/v2/stories/styles/presets`
   - `GET /api/v2/stories/styles/presets`
   - `DELETE /api/v2/stories/styles/presets/{id}`

2. **Database Schema** (High Priority)
   - Add style columns to text_blocks table
   - Create style_presets table
   - Add variant storage structure
   - Migration script for existing data

3. **Validation Service** (Medium Priority)
   - Server-side style validation
   - Content moderation for text
   - XSS prevention for custom styles
   - Rate limiting for style saves

### AI Integration
1. **Variant Generation** (Low Priority - Phase 2)
   - Integrate with GPT for variant suggestions
   - Implement vocabulary level analysis
   - Add reading difficulty scoring
   - Create age-appropriate rewrites

2. **Smart Selection** (Low Priority - Phase 2)
   - Build heuristic for variant selection
   - Track child reading patterns
   - Adaptive difficulty adjustment
   - Performance analytics

## Testing Requirements üß™
- [ ] Unit tests for style utilities
- [ ] Component tests for TextStyleEditor
- [ ] Integration tests for variant selection
- [ ] E2E tests for complete text editing flow
- [ ] Cross-browser CSS compatibility
- [ ] Performance testing with many text blocks
- [ ] Accessibility audit

## Bug Fixes üêõ
- [ ] Animation keyframes need scoping (currently global)
- [ ] Gradient stop manipulation needs better UX
- [ ] Color contrast validation for accessibility
- [ ] Memory leak in animation useEffect cleanup
- [ ] Style preview not updating in real-time

## Documentation üìö
- [ ] User guide for text styling features
- [ ] API documentation for new endpoints
- [ ] Migration guide for existing stories
- [ ] Style preset creation tutorial
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Performance Optimizations ‚ö°
- [ ] Implement style caching
- [ ] Add virtual scrolling for variant lists
- [ ] Optimize re-renders on style changes
- [ ] Lazy load preset thumbnails
- [ ] Debounce style updates

## Questions for Product Team ‚ùì
1. Should we limit the number of variants per text block?
2. What should be the default animation duration?
3. Should custom presets be shareable between users?
4. Do we need style versioning/history?
5. Should AI-generated variants require parent approval?

## Dependencies to Add üì¶
- [x] react-colorful (installed)
- [ ] react-rnd (for resize/drag)
- [ ] dompurify (for XSS prevention)
- [ ] color (for color manipulation)

## Estimated Timeline ‚è∞
- Frontend Integration: 2-3 days
- Backend Implementation: 3-4 days
- Testing & QA: 2 days
- Documentation: 1 day
- **Total: ~2 weeks for full implementation**

## Risk Factors ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Performance impact with many styled text blocks
- Browser compatibility for advanced CSS features
- Migration complexity for existing stories
- Potential conflicts with existing text editing
- Mobile gesture handling complexity

## Next Immediate Steps üéØ
1. Integrate TextStyleEditor into StoryCanvas
2. Test with real story data
3. Fix any immediate bugs found
4. Create backend API endpoints
5. Update database schema

## Notes üìå
- Frontend components are feature-complete but not integrated
- Style system is flexible enough for future enhancements
- Preset system can be extended with user submissions
- Architecture supports real-time collaboration (future)
- Consider A/B testing different default presets
