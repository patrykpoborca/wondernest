- ‚ùå Family routes are stub implementations only
- ‚ùå No business logic for family CRUD operations
- ‚ùå Child profile management completely missing

**Flutter Expectations vs Backend Reality:**
```kotlin
// Flutter expects: GET /children (list all children for authenticated parent)
// Backend has: GET /children -> "Children profiles endpoint - TODO"

// Flutter expects: POST /children (create child profile)
// Backend has: POST /children -> "Create child profile - TODO"
```

#### 3. **Content Management** - 5% Complete
**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Content database schema exists
- ‚úÖ Age-appropriate filtering architecture designed
- ‚ùå Content routes are placeholder implementations
- ‚ùå No content recommendation logic
- ‚ùå No age-based filtering implementation

**Flutter Expectations vs Backend Reality:**
```kotlin
// Flutter expects: GET /content?category=X&ageGroup=Y
// Backend has: GET /content/library -> "Content library endpoint - TODO"
```

#### 4. **Analytics & Activity Tracking** - 0% Complete
**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Analytics database schema designed
- ‚ùå No analytics routes implemented
- ‚ùå No activity tracking logic
- ‚ùå No game progress saving

**Flutter Expectations vs Backend Reality:**
```kotlin
// Flutter expects: GET /analytics/daily?childId=X
// Backend has: No analytics endpoints at all
```

## üéØ Core App Loop Requirements Analysis

### **Priority 1: Parent Authentication Flow**
The Flutter app expects a complete parent authentication system that currently doesn't exist.

**Missing Components:**
1. Parent-specific registration with family creation
2. Parent login with family context
3. Profile management endpoints
4. Session management for active sessions

**Impact on Flutter:** Cannot test real authentication, currently using mock service

### **Priority 2: Child Management System**
This is the heart of the app - parents need to create and manage child profiles.

**Missing Components:**
1. Child profile CRUD operations
2. Child-parent relationship management
3. Child authentication (PIN-based)
4. Active child session tracking

**Impact on Flutter:** Cannot persist child selections, no real child switching

### **Priority 3: Content Delivery System**
Children need age-appropriate content based on their profiles.

**Missing Components:**
1. Content filtering by age
2. Content recommendation engine
3. Content category management
4. Content engagement tracking

**Impact on Flutter:** No real content to display, cannot test filtering

### **Priority 4: Activity & Analytics**
Parents need insights into their children's usage patterns.

**Missing Components:**
1. Activity logging endpoints
2. Screen time tracking
3. Usage analytics generation
4. Parental dashboard data

**Impact on Flutter:** Parent dashboard shows no real data

// Backend has: POST /auth/refresh
// Status: ‚úÖ Compatible (just different path)
```

## üî• Critical Blockers for Flutter Testing

### **Blocker 1: Authentication System**
**Issue:** Flutter cannot test real authentication because backend auth is incomplete
**Impact:** High - Core app functionality cannot be tested
**Resolution:** Complete Phase 1 (Parent Authentication Service)

### **Blocker 2: Child Management**
**Issue:** Child selection and switching doesn't persist
**Impact:** High - Primary user flow broken
**Resolution:** Complete Phase 2 (Child CRUD Operations)

### **Blocker 3: Content Delivery**
**Issue:** No real content to display in child mode
**Impact:** Medium - UI can be tested but not content logic
**Resolution:** Complete Phase 3.1 (Basic Content Management)

### **Blocker 4: Parent Dashboard**
**Issue:** No analytics data for parent insights
**Impact:** Medium - Parent experience incomplete
**Resolution:** Complete Phase 4 (Analytics & Tracking)

## üìä Data Model Alignment Issues

### **Child Profile Model Mismatch:**

**Flutter Model Fields:**
```dart
class ChildProfile {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final int age;            // Calculated field
  final String? avatarUrl;
  final DateTime birthDate;
  final String gender;
  final List<String> interests;
  final ContentSettings contentSettings;    // Complex nested object
  final TimeRestrictions timeRestrictions; // Complex nested object
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final DateTime updatedAt;
}
```

**Backend Database Schema:**
```kotlin
object ChildProfiles : UUIDTable("child_profiles") {
    val firstName = varchar("first_name", 100)  // Flutter expects "name"
    val birthDate = date("birth_date")          // ‚úÖ Matches
    val gender = varchar("gender", 20)          // ‚úÖ Matches
    val contentPreferences = jsonb<ContentPreferences>() // Different from Flutter
    // Missing: ContentSettings and TimeRestrictions as Flutter expects
}
```

**Required Mapping Work:**
- [ ] Create DTOs that exactly match Flutter models
- [ ] Implement age calculation from birthDate
- [ ] Map contentPreferences to ContentSettings
- [ ] Create TimeRestrictions from family settings
- [ ] Add proper serialization/deserialization

## ‚ö° Quick Wins (Can be implemented immediately)

### **1. Health Check Endpoint** (30 minutes)
```kotlin
// Flutter calls: GET /health
// Backend has: GET /health (working)
// Status: ‚úÖ Already working
```

### **2. Basic Auth Structure** (1 hour)
```kotlin
// Update auth routes to match Flutter paths
// Add proper error responses
// Status: üü° Needs path updates only
```

### **3. Database Connection** (30 minutes)
```kotlin
// Verify database is accessible and migrations run
// Status: ‚úÖ Already working
```
