   - Total words spoken TO child
   - Words spoken BY child
   - Conversational turns

2. **Language Quality Analysis**
   - Vocabulary diversity score
   - Sentence complexity metrics
   - Question frequency (promotes thinking)

3. **Environmental Factors**
   - Background TV/screen audio detection

### Privacy-First Audio Processing

#### Technical Implementation
```python
class PrivacyAudioProcessor:
    def process_audio(self, audio_stream):
        # On-device processing
        features = self.extract_features(audio_stream)
        
        # Immediate deletion
        del audio_stream
        
        # Statistical only
        metrics = self.calculate_metrics(features)
        
        # Differential privacy
        private_metrics = self.add_noise(metrics)
        
        # Encrypted transmission
        return self.encrypt(private_metrics)
```

#### Data Flow
1. **Capture**: Audio recorded on device
2. **Process**: Local ML model extraction
3. **Extract**: Statistical features only
4. **Delete**: Raw audio immediate deletion
5. **Transmit**: Encrypted metrics only
6. **Store**: Aggregated data with parent access
