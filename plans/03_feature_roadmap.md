# WonderNest Feature Roadmap & Prioritization
## Strategic Product Development Plan

---

# Executive Summary

This document outlines WonderNest's feature development roadmap, prioritization framework, and success metrics. Using a phased approach, we'll build from a focused MVP to a comprehensive platform, always prioritizing features that deliver maximum value to parents while maintaining technical feasibility and business viability.

---

# 1. Prioritization Framework

## 1.1 RICE Scoring Model

We use RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to prioritize features:

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

### Scoring Criteria
- **Reach**: Number of users affected per quarter (0-10,000+)
- **Impact**: 3 (Massive), 2 (High), 1 (Medium), 0.5 (Low), 0.25 (Minimal)
- **Confidence**: 100% (High), 80% (Medium), 50% (Low)
- **Effort**: Person-months required

## 1.2 Strategic Priorities

### Priority Matrix
```
High Impact + Low Effort = IMMEDIATE
High Impact + High Effort = STRATEGIC
Low Impact + Low Effort = QUICK WINS
Low Impact + High Effort = DEPRIORITIZE
```

### Core Principles
1. **Safety First**: Child safety features always highest priority
2. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy features integrated, not added
3. **Parent Value**: Every feature must reduce anxiety or save time
4. **Scientific Backing**: Evidence-based features only
5. **Simplicity**: Complexity is the enemy of adoption
