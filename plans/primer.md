# Mini-Game Architecture Primer
*A Strategic Overview and Justification*

## Executive Summary

This primer provides the strategic context and justification for the comprehensive mini-game and applet architecture detailed in `mini_game_and_applet.md`. The architecture represents a critical evolution of WonderNest from a simple child safety app to a developmental platform that combines entertainment, education, and insights.

## Why Mini-Games Matter for WonderNest

### 1. **Engagement is Essential for Data Collection**
- **Problem**: Traditional parental control apps are passive - they restrict but don't engage
- **Solution**: Mini-games create voluntary, enthusiastic engagement from children
- **Impact**: More engagement = more behavioral data = better developmental insights

### 2. **Developmental Insights Through Play**
- **Scientific Basis**: Play patterns reveal cognitive development, learning preferences, and potential areas of concern
- **Practical Application**: A child struggling with pattern-matching games might benefit from additional spatial reasoning support
- **Parent Value**: Actionable insights beyond "screen time reports"

### 3. **Market Differentiation**
- **Current Market**: Parental controls (restrictive) OR educational games (no safety)
- **WonderNest Position**: Safe, educational, entertaining, AND insightful
- **Competitive Moat**: Integrated ecosystem that grows with the child

## Architectural Philosophy

### Why This Specific Design?

#### **1. Schema Isolation (games schema)**
**Justification**: 
- Separates game logic from core user data
- Enables independent scaling (game servers vs. core servers)
- Allows different backup/retention policies
- Simplifies compliance (COPPA applies differently to game data)

**Alternative Considered**: Single schema with prefixed tables
**Why Rejected**: Mixing concerns, harder to maintain, scaling bottlenecks

#### **2. JSONB for Game-Specific Data**
**Justification**:
- Each game has unique data requirements (stickers have rarity, math games have difficulty)
- Schema migrations for every new game would be unsustainable
- PostgreSQL's JSONB offers NoSQL flexibility with SQL reliability
- Indexed JSONB queries are fast enough for our scale

**Alternative Considered**: Separate table per game type
**Why Rejected**: Explosion of tables, complex joins, migration nightmare

#### **3. Plugin Architecture**
**Justification**:
- New games can be added without modifying core system
- Third-party developers could contribute games (future)
- Testing isolation - each game tested independently
- Deployment flexibility - games can be updated separately

**Alternative Considered**: Monolithic game service
**Why Rejected**: Slow development, risky deployments, limited extensibility

## Security & Privacy Decisions

### Why Multiple Security Layers?

1. **Database Level (RLS)**: Even if application is compromised, database protects data
2. **Application Level**: Business logic enforcement, complex rules
3. **API Level**: Rate limiting, authentication, prevents direct database access
4. **Audit Level**: Every access logged for compliance and debugging

**Real Scenario**: If a vulnerability allows Child A to attempt accessing Child B's data:
- API auth check fails (different family)
- If bypassed, application service check fails
- If bypassed, database RLS fails
- Attempt is logged for security review

### COPPA Compliance Built-In

**Why Not Add Later?**
- Retroactive compliance is 10x harder than built-in
- FTC fines can reach millions of dollars
- Trust is earned once and lost forever
- Parents need confidence from day one

**Design Impacts**:
- No personal data in game_data JSONB
- Achievement names are pre-defined (not user-generated)
- Analytics are aggregated, never individual
- 13-year auto-expiry on all game data

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Scale vs. Future Scale

**Phase 1 (Launch)**: 1,000 families
- Current design handles this with single server
- Over-engineered? No - establishing patterns

**Phase 2 (Growth)**: 100,000 families
- Schema isolation enables read replicas for games
- JSONB indexes maintain query performance
- Caching layer (Redis) for hot data

**Phase 3 (Scale)**: 10M families
- Game data can move to separate database cluster
- Individual games can have dedicated services
- Analytics can move to data warehouse

### Why Design for Scale Now?

1. **Migration Pain**: Moving 10M records > designing correctly for 1K
2. **Investor Confidence**: Architecture supports unicorn scale
3. **Developer Velocity**: Good patterns accelerate development
4. **Technical Debt**: Compounds faster than financial debt

## Implementation Strategy Justification

### Why 16 Weeks?

**Weeks 1-4 (Infrastructure)**: Foundation must be rock-solid
- Database errors are hard to fix in production
- Schema changes are risky with live data
- Good infrastructure accelerates everything else

**Weeks 5-8 (Management)**: Admin before features
- Parents need control from day one
- Support needs visibility for troubleshooting
- Metrics needed to measure success

**Weeks 9-12 (First Game)**: Proof of concept
- Stickers are simple enough to build quickly
- Complex enough to test all systems
- Appealing to wide age range
- Clear monetization path (premium sticker packs)

**Weeks 13-16 (Analytics)**: Insights are the differentiator
- Without insights, we're just another game platform
- Parents pay for understanding, not entertainment
- Data scientists need this for ML models (future)

### Why Sticker Collection First?

1. **Universal Appeal**: 3-year-olds to 13-year-olds understand collecting
2. **Simple Mechanics**: Earn, collect, trade - no complex rules
3. **Rich Data**: Collection patterns, trading behavior, aesthetic preferences
4. **Monetization Ready**: Premium packs, seasonal collections
5. **Social Features**: Safe trading teaches sharing and negotiation

## Business Model Implications

### How Games Enable Revenue

**Free Tier**: 
- 3 basic games
- Limited analytics
- Builds habit and trust

**Premium Tier ($9.99/month)**:
- Unlimited games
- Detailed insights
- Custom achievements
- Priority support

**Game Purchases ($0.99-$4.99)**:
- Premium sticker packs
- Advanced game levels
- Seasonal content
- Parent-approved only

### Why This Monetization Works

1. **Parents Pay for Peace of Mind**: Safe, educational entertainment
2. **Children Drive Engagement**: "Mom, can I get the dinosaur pack?"
3. **Recurring Revenue**: Subscriptions > one-time purchases
4. **High LTV**: Families use for years as children grow

## Technical Decisions Explained

### Why PostgreSQL for Games?

**Considered**: MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra
**Decision**: PostgreSQL with JSONB

**Reasons**:
1. Already in stack (no new operational overhead)
2. ACID guarantees (critical for achievements, purchases)
3. JSONB gives NoSQL flexibility when needed
4. SQL for analytics queries
5. Proven scale (Discord, Instagram use PostgreSQL)

### Why Not Microservices Yet?

**Current**: Modular monolith
**Future**: Can extract games to microservices

**Reasons**:
1. Premature optimization is evil
2. Small team can't maintain 10 services
3. Network latency between services adds complexity
4. Can extract later when needed
5. Modular design enables extraction

### Why Plugin Architecture?

**Pattern**: Strategy pattern with dependency injection
**Benefit**: New games are isolated implementations

**Example Impact**:
- Current: Deploy entire backend for new game
- With Plugins: Deploy just game JAR
- Result: 10x faster iteration, lower risk

## Risk Mitigation

### What Could Go Wrong?

1. **Risk**: Children exploit games for unlimited rewards
   **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, anomaly detection, parent notifications

2. **Risk**: Game data corrupts child profile
   **Mitigation**: Isolated schemas, transaction boundaries, audit logs

3. **Risk**: Popular game creates scaling crisis
   **Mitigation**: Horizontal scaling ready, cache layer, CDN for assets

4. **Risk**: Inappropriate content in user-generated data
   **Mitigation**: No user-generated content in phase 1, pre-moderated content only

5. **Risk**: COPPA violation from game data
   **Mitigation**: Privacy-by-design, automatic data expiry, audit trails

## Success Metrics

### How We'll Know It's Working

**Technical Metrics**:
- API response time < 100ms (p95)
- Zero data leaks between children
- 99.9% uptime for game services
