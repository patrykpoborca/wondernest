# Test Cross-Device Sticker Book Sync

## Problem Identified
The sticker books were not syncing across devices because:

1. **SavedProjectsService only loaded from local storage** - It never actually fetched from backend
2. **ApiService.getChildGameData() returned mock data** - Instead of calling real backend endpoint
3. **No backend endpoint existed** - To retrieve saved sticker book project data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes
- **Added analytics endpoint** `/analytics/children/{childId}/events` to retrieve game data
- **Enhanced analytics POST endpoint** to detect and store sticker book project saves
- **Added in-memory storage** `gameDataStorage` to persist project data across requests
- **Added deletion handling** for proper project cleanup

### 2. Frontend Changes  
- **Fixed ApiService.getChildGameData()** - Now calls real backend endpoint instead of returning mock
- **Enhanced SavedProjectsService** - Now sends full project JSON in `fullProjectData` field for storage
- **Maintained existing merge logic** - Projects are still merged with local taking precedence when timestamps are newer

### 3. Data Flow
1. **Save**: Project → SavedProjectsService → ApiService.saveGameEvent() → Backend analytics endpoint → In-memory storage
2. **Load**: SavedProjectsService → ApiService.getChildGameData() → Backend analytics endpoint → Return stored projects
3. **Merge**: Backend projects are merged with local projects, with newer timestamps winning

## Testing Required
1. Create sticker project on Device A
2. Switch to Device B with same account
3. Verify project appears on Device B
4. Edit project on Device B
5. Switch back to Device A
6. Verify changes sync back
